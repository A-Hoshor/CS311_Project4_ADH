                    <p style = "text-align:center">=========================</p><br>
                    
                    &emsp;Richard Wagner was born in Venice on May 22, 1813. As a youth, he
                    studied music in Leipzig. His first opera, "Die Feen" was written at the
                    age of 20, in 1833. This was followed in 1836 with the unsuccessful
                    "Das Liebesverbot". That same year, Wagner married the actress Minna
                    Planer. Wagner and his family lived for a few years in Königsberg, and
                    then later, in Riga. While in Paris from 1839 to 1842, he composed the
                    grand opera, "Rienzi," and the tragedy, "Der Fliegende Holländer."<br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp;The success of "Rienzi" led to Wagner's appointment as music director in
                    Dresden. More successes followed with "Tannhäuser" in 1845 and "Lohengrin"
                    in 1850. However, at the same time, Wagner became involved with political
                    radicals. He was forced to Switzerland after his participation in the 
                    1849 Dresden uprisings.<br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp;In exile, Wagner began work on his four opera cycle, "Der Ring des 
                    Nibelungen," which occupied much of his life. Taking time off from his 
                    work on the "Ring", Wagner composed the romantic tragedy, "Tristan und
                    Isolde." The opera, "Die Meistersinger" followed a few years later. This
                    opera is notorious for the anti-Semitic expressions of the protagonist.<br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp;In 1860, he was allowed to return to Germany. A triumphant performance of 
                    "Tannhäuser" in Paris confirmed Wagner's stature as international artist of 
                    great renown. <br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp;Finally in 1876, the "Ring" premiered in Bayreuth. The strain of raising
                    money and getting the production ready greatly affected Wagner's health.
                    His final opera, "Parsifal," was presented at the second Bayreuth festival
                    in 1882.<br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp;Wagner died on February 13th, 1883 at the age of 69.
