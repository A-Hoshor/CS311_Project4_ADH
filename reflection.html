<h1>Reflections</h1>
    The first issue/problem I ran into was sizing my columns to make sense even as I scaled webpage
    from small to the largest my computer will support. I did have to look up a few tutorials, and 
    even now I'm unsure if the way I set them up are best practices.

    FlexBox:
    I did attempt to incorporate the Flexbox option into my website, however I could not figure out 
    how to align it all properly with what I already had. Originally, I tried to put my navbar/menu into a flexbox, and 
    center it so that the menu took up the whole page and evenly distributed the buttons along the bar.
    However, all I could get it to do was center them all into a very small centered navbar, which I did not enjoy the look of,
    so I got rid of it in order to preserve the look of the website.
